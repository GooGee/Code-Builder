# Code-Builder

A TypeScript code builder, based on Electron.

Using TypeScript Compiler API and Abstract Syntax Tree to achieve visual programming.

No need to write any code, just input names and constants, and add logic by GUI, then generate code.

This project is currently in the early stage of development.
